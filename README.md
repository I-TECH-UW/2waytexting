## Overview of Installation
These very basic instructions should help get you started:
- Set up a server running with the [Community Health Toolkit](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/)
- Set up a RapidPro server, or use a software-as-a-service version, such as [TextIt](https://textit.com/), and import `rapidpro.json`
- Set up the [credentials on your CHT server for using RapidPro](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/guides/messaging/gateways/rapidpro/#cht-core-configuration)
- Update the CHT configuration from this repo as needed, including the RapidPro flow IDs
- Push the configuration to your CHT server
